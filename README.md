# Youtube Clone

A Front End Clone of Youtube made with React!
I added my own styling and a darker theme that would focus on the video player.

I also added a Full Screen option for the video player.
If you want to check it out, go to the directory where you want to clone it and then:

`git clone https://github.com/rja907/Youtube-Clone.git`

`npm install`

`npm start`

Then, go to your web browser and check out localhost:8080.
Let me know what you thought about it!
